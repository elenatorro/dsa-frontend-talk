## Trees: Virtual DOM

### What's the Virtual DOM?

* The virtual DOM was created to solve these problems of needing to **frequently update** the DOM in a **more performant** way

* It isn't an official specification, but rather a **new method** of interfacing with the DOM.

* It is a **copy** of the original DOM that can be **frequently manipulated and updated**, without using the DOM APIs

### How does it work? 

* The first thing we would do is make a copy of the virtual DOM, **containing the changes** we want to make

* This copy is used to create what is called a **“diff”** between the original virtual DOM and the updated one.

* Once all the diffs are collected, we can batch changes to the DOM, making **only the updates that are needed.**
