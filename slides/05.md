# Concepts

## Algorithm

> An algorithm is a series of steps or rules for solving a problem.

## Algorithm Efficiency

> The study of the amount of resources used by an algorithm.

- The less resources used by the algorithm the more efficient it is.
- Types:
    - **Time efficiency**: a measure of amount of time an algorithm takes to solve a problem.
    - **Space efficiency**: a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs to solve a problem.
    - **Complexity theory**: a study of algorithm performance based on cost functions of statement counts.

## Algorithm Complexity

> How fast or slow particular algorithm performs for different input data. We define complexity as a numerical function T(n) - time versus the input size n.
