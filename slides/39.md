# Data Structures

## Trees: Virtual DOM

* React implements the "Reconciliation Algorithm"
* From ${O(n^3)}$ to ${O(n)}$ by relying on two assumptions:
    * Identifies elements with **unique ids** -> compare **by key** id instead of **by element**
    * Two elements of different types will produce **different trees** -> no need to diff, just **replaces** them
