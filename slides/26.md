# Data Structures

## Map

* The Map object holds **key-value** pairs and remembers the original **insertion order** of the keys.

* Object is **similar** to Map in that both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key.

* **Any value** (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value

* You can get the size of a Map easily with the **size** property

* The keys of an Object are String and Symbol, whereas they can be any value for a Map, including functions, objects, and any primitive.

* A Map may **perform better** in scenarios involving **frequent addition** and **removal** of key pairs
