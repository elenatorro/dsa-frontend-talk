# Data Structures

## WeakMap and WeakSet

* Map and Set‘s references to objects are strongly held and will not allow for **garbage collection**.

* This can get expensive if maps/sets reference large objects that are no longer needed, such as DOM elements that have already been removed from the DOM.

* `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` collections are ‘weak’ because they allow for objects which are no longer needed to be cleared from memory.
